  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Aigaion system is used to maintain an annotated bibliography. This can be your own personal bibliography, or a database that is shared between a group of people working on similar topics.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Aigaion are the topic tree and the notes. The topic tree is used to organize your bibliography in themes and topics, where a publication can be added to any number of topics that are relevant to it. The notes form a way in which you can summarize a paper in your own style, indicate why the paper is relevant for your research, why you think a paper belongs to a certain topic, whether you think the paper succeeded in its intended goal, etc.\r\n\r\n## CLEAN INSTALL\r\n    \r\nThis documentation is for installing Aigaion 2.5 from scratch, with an empty database\r\n    \r\n    1)  Copy the Aigaion 2.5 files from the www folder to <WEBROOT>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/\r\n    2)  Create a new MySQL database '<db_aigaion2>', with an appropriate user.
